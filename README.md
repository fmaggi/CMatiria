# Matiria
/məˈtɪərɪə/

Hobby programming language
Matiria is a staticaly typed language. I havent fully decided the syntax yet so it will change.

## Building

In the build directory there is a premake5 file and a makefile I made myself.
Pick whichever you prefer and move it to the root directory of the project.

The premake5 script will create bin and bin_int directories and put executables and obejct files there.

The makefile I made will put object files next to source files and libraries and executable in the root directory.
